    <ol>
      <h2>Did you learn any new hobbies while in quarantine?</h2>

      <p> Using the power of YouTube she taught herself how to crochet during lockdown. She ended up crocheting her own stockings in time for the holiday season. </p>

      <h2>Who is your favorite Animal Crossings character?</h2>

      <p> 
        Marina, the strawberry pink octopus with light yellow cheeks, is Marisa's favorite Animal Crossing character. Her name is from the word marine, a general term for things relating to the sea or ocean. </p>

      <ol> 
        <li>She is a great villager</li>
        <li>Marina has an energetic personality</li>

<h2>What is life like on the island with Marina? </h2>
<p> Marina has a vibrant personality, and frequently acts kind towards the villagers. She is usally up early in the morning and likes to engage with her fellow friends. She has a lovely taste in furniture which showcases her playful side. </p>

      <h2>What's the grossest food you've ever eaten?</h2>

      <p> The grossest food Marisa has ever eaten was a Halloween edition flavored ice cream that had bugs in it. Reminded me of the Salt & Straw spooky seasonal ice cream flavor <em>Creepy Crawly Critters</em>, littered with chocolate covered crickets and toffee-brittle mealworms. Mmm, appetizing.</p>
